# Weather Attribution Constrained Weather Generator (WG) â€“ Frio Basin

This repository provides the source code for a custom weather generator (WG) that includes extreme events. A schematic for the WG framework is displayed below. The purpose of this WG framework is to enable calibration to drought magnitudes and likelihoods, under human induced climate change. After calibration, the attribution constrained WG will provide a climate description that provides increased probability of future occurrence for what was historically severe and extreme drought relative to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), global climate model (GCM) simulation results.

## Source Code

The WG source code is available at [**src**](https://nmartin198.github.io/wattrib_wg_frio/tree/main/src).


## Calibration Example

An example calibration to a weather attribution study findings is presented in [**calibration**](https://nmartin198.github.io/wattrib_wg_frio/tree/main/calibration).


## Implementation Example

Implementation of the attribution constrained WG to produce an ensemble of stochastic day-to-day weather realizations is provided in [**final**](https://nmartin198.github.io/wattrib_wg_frio/tree/main/final).
